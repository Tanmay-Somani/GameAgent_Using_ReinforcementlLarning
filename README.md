# GameAgent_Using_ReinforcementLearning
This project uses reinforcement learning to train agents to play a variety of classic video games. The agents learn to navigate levels, avoid obstacles, and defeat enemies by maximizing cumulative rewards through trial and error.

## Features
- Environment setup for various classic video games
- Implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms, such as DDQN
- Training process with reward-based learning
- Evaluation of agent performance across different games

## Available Games
1. **Super Mario Bros**
2. **Snake Game**
