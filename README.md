# SuperMarioBros_Using_ReinforcementlLarning
This project uses reinforcement learning to train an agent to play Super Mario Bros. The agent learns to navigate levels, avoid obstacles, and defeat enemies by maximizing cumulative rewards through trial and error.
## Features
Environment setup for Super Mario Bros
Implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms *DDQN*
Training process with reward-based learning
Evaluation of agent performance
